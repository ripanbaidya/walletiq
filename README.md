## About

WalletIQ is an intelligent expense tracking and budget advisory platform that uses AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide personalized, data-driven financial insights.

Users can track income and expenses, plan budgets, and interact with an AI assistant that analyzes their actual financial data to deliver context-aware budgeting advice—not generic tips. By grounding AI responses in real user spending patterns, WalletIQ ensures recommendations are accurate, explainable, and actionable.

The platform is designed with a scalable, enterprise-grade backend architecture, making it easy to extend with additional financial features and advanced AI capabilities in the future.
